# Scratchpad
While learning something, one usually writes notes.
By looking at a note, one can quickly recall what one has learned and accomplished.
If one does not organize their notes, information retrieval becomes difficult, if not impossible.

Code is the best type of note for programming.
One can recall a concept from others' code, but it usually takes much longer than looking at one's own snippets.

In this repo, I will put stuff that I usually throw away or simply lose over time.
